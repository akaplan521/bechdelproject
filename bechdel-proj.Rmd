I. Introduction: At the beginning of your paper, you must describe the data, in a paragraph. Note the following:
 What is the source of the data? Where and when was it created?
 If it is a sample, from what population was it drawn, and how was the sample selected?
 Do you suspect any sampling bias?
 Was it an experiment or an observational study?
 How were measurements taken, or questions asked?
 Do you suspect any bias in the questions or measurements?
 Why is this data of interest to you, and why should the class find it interesting?
 What kind of data cleaning was necessary (R code for this must show…)
(^^Just for reference, will be deleted^^)

## Introduction

The **Bechdel Test** ...


```{r question 1 - Introduction}
#data cleaning here described above...
bechdel_factored <- bechdel |> 
  mutate(score = case_when(Btest5 == "1 ok" ~ 1,
                           Btest5 == "2 dubious" ~ 2,
                           Btest5 == "3 men" ~ 3,
                           Btest5 == "4 notalk" ~ 4,
                           Btest5 == "5 nowomen" ~ 5)) |> 
  select(-Btest5)
  
```

II. Data Visualizations: Write R code to create some relevant descriptive graphs, using techniques that
we’ve used in class (ggplot, maybe dplyr). About 4 or 5 graphs should be plenty, depending on
complexity.
For each graph and numerical summary, write a paragraph or two summarizing what you see, and
suggesting some implications. For example, describe patterns that you observe in a graph, and
suggest why they make sense, given what you know about the subject, or if they are unexpected.
Do you think there is a cause-effect relationship between any variables? Explain your reasoning.

## Data Visualizations


```{r question 2 - Data Visualizations}
 bechdByRating <-
  ggplot(
    data = bechdel_factored,
    mapping = aes(
      x = averating,
      y = score
    )
  ) +
  geom_line()

bechdHist <-
  ggplot(
    data = bechdel_factored,
    mapping = aes(x = score)
  ) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_reverse()

# show graphs
bechdByRating
bechdHist
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
